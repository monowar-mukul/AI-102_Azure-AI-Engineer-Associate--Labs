### ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository contains the **final state of code from my testing lab setup**, prepared **for training and educational purposes**.
While the code has been verified in a controlled lab environment, it may not be fully validated for production use.
Please ensure you **thoroughly test** in a **lower (non-production) environment** before applying any changes to live systems.

> **Always test, test, and test again** — validate all configurations and behaviours in your own controlled setup before production deployment.
> **Note**: Azure Cloud Console is live - so ongoing update is happening. You may experience some location changes for the option selection.
